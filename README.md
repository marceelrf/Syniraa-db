# Syniraa-db

Syniraa-db is a database of infrared spectra of amino acids generated by simulation using the ORCA software. These simulated spectra were then used to build a synthetic infrared spectrum library. This library is intended to be used as data for training and educational purposes, especially in the areas of data science, machine learning, and organic chemistry.
