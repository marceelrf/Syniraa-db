# Syniraa-db

Syniraa-db is a database of infrared spectra of amino acids generated by simulation using the [Orca](ttps://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal). These simulated spectra were then used to build a synthetic infrared spectrum library. This library is intended to be used as data for training and educational purposes, especially in the areas of data science, machine learning, and organic chemistry.

- *ORCAsimulations* folder contains the files generate by geometry optimzation using **ORCA**.
- The *SyntheticData* folder contains the 1000 .RData files built with the *synthpop* package.
